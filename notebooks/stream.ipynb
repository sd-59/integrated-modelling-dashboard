    "# Hydrological Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned during the lecture, there are many different water models around. In this practical you will work with a raster-based hydrological model to simulate river discharge of the Colorado river in the USA. This model, called STREAM, is programmed in Python and used in various studies performed at IVM. In this practical, STREAM will be runned using a monthly time step, meaning that the model makes a calculation for each month to estimate river discharge and other variables. There are questions throughout this practical which you have to answer in the accompanying excel file (see the separate sheet ‘Answers’). This practical will not be graded, but as you will work with STREAM yourself from tomorrow onwards, it is an important introduction.\n",

    "# STREAM\n",
    "\n",
    "STREAM is a distributed grid-based water-balance model and describes the hydrological cycle of a drainage basin as a series of storage compartments and flows. STREAM calculates per grid cell a water balance. The model consists of three storage reservoirs: snow storage, soil moisture storage and groundwater storage, dividing outflow into a fast and a slow component. The fast component is affected by soil moisture storage and the slow component by ground water storage, both behaving as linear reservoirs. Potential evapotranspiration is derived from surface temperature, following the approach of Thornthwaite and Mather (1957). Snow accumulation is equal to precipitation when temperature is below zero degrees Celsius, and snow melts linearly depending on temperature. Both fast and slow flows are routed to the basin outlet by flow accumulation using an elevation and assuming that all water moves through the system in one time step (in case of this practical: month). Because STREAM only needs precipitation and temperature as dynamic input variables, it is relatively simple and transparent to use. \n",

    "Open the excel file named ‘CP1_HydroModel.xlsx’. In this excel file you will see several sheets. The first one ‘ClimateNumbering’ shows a table indicating which iteration number corresponds with which month (column) and year (row). Take a look at this sheet and look up the iteration number that corresponds to January 1910 and December 1914. This 5-year period will be used to calibrate the model. If you go to the next sheet ‘Calibration’, you’ll see observed discharge data (at Yuma, Arizona) for the period 1910-1914 in column C. There are also two graphs with show the discharge throughout these 5 years (top graph), and the average discharge per month (bottom graph). In column D there is place to paste the modelled data from the hydrological model STREAM (reddish cells). Other sheets in the excel file include ‘LongRuns’, ‘FullRuns’ and ‘Answers’. The ‘LongRuns’ and ‘FullRuns’ sheets we will use later when the model is calibrated and the ‘Answers’ tab gives questions that need answering over the course of this practical.        \n",

We are going to do this for the last 6 years in our set (1989-1994) as we miss some data for 1988. The easiest thing to do is to first translate the m3/sec into m3/month. Do this in column F by multiplying the m3/sec with the amount of seconds that is in a month (assumed 30 days a month). Then we can recalculate the m3 into acre-feet, as that is the unit used in the USA for such numbers. One acre-foot corresponds to 1233.48 m3. Recalculate your m3 in column F to acre-feet in column G. Then use excel to calculate the average water use as modelled by our model per year.   \n",
